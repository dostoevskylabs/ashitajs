================================

ashitajs intends to be a fully decentralized P2P network (though not there yet) designed to be deployed anywhere. It's still in its infancy and a lot of work still needs to be done. Currently a PoC so security may be non-existent. Run at your own risk.

As a test case you can run
```javascript
npm install
nodejs index.js 8000
```

Then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:60000/
