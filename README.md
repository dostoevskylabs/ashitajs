ashitajs - Distributed P2P Trash
================================
I don't even know what this is I'm just building it.

Next we need to install our modules from the main directory with server.js
```bash
npm install
```
Now we are ready to start our client which we awkwardly named server.js (it's a node technically)
```bash
node server.js eth0
```
